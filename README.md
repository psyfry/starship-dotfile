## Ridiculous starship CLI prompts

Requires a patched nerdfont for icons to work. Wide selection available to download here: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
Alternatively, you can follow the instructions to patch the icons onto any other font of your choosing(https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher). Once you have a nerd font you like, set it as your terminal emulator font and it should be good to go.

## Installation
To use the config, follow the starship install instructions for your distro, then clone/copy the starship.toml file into your ~/.config/ directory. 
Depending on what tools you use, you may want to customize starship further by adding, removing or changing sections of the starship.toml config. Starship has well-written docs that are easy to follow here: https://starship.rs/config/
